If you've ever built a frontend that talks to an API, you've probably seen that big red CORS error in your browser console. It's annoying, confusing, and often misunderstood.

In this post, we'll bust a couple of common myths — especially the idea that CORS is a security feature, or that it explains why something works in Postman but not in the browser.

Let's get clear on what CORS actually does — and what it doesn't.

## **What is CORS, really?**

CORS stands for **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing**. It's not a library, it's not a server plugin, and it's definitely not an API security tool.

It's a **browser feature**. Full stop.

When your frontend JavaScript tries to make a request to a different origin — for example:

* Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
* API: `https://api.example.com`

— the browser will say:
"Hang on, are you allowed to talk to that domain?"

Unless the API responds with the right headers, the browser will block the request before it even leaves your machine.

Here's a basic success response header from the server:

```http
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:3000
```

And that's it. No header, no request. But again — **this only happens in browsers**.

## **Myth: CORS applies everywhere**

Nope. **CORS only exists in the browser**. It has nothing to do with the server-side, Postman, curl, or your backend code.

Postman will happily make the same request that the browser blocks. It doesn't care about CORS headers. That's why your API might "work in Postman but not in the browser."

The browser is enforcing rules on behalf of the user. That's all.

## **A quick word on preflight**

When you send anything other than a simple `GET` or `POST` (like `PUT`, `DELETE`, custom headers, etc.), the browser doesn't go straight to your API. It first sends an automatic **OPTIONS** request to check if it's allowed — this is called a **preflight request**.

If your server doesn't handle that preflight properly — by sending back the right headers — your main request never gets sent.

So the real issue isn't always your API logic. It might just be missing a proper response to a question the browser asked first.

## **Myth: Adding CORS makes your API secure**

This one's dangerous.

Just because your API only allows requests from `https://some-frontend.com` doesn't mean it's protected. Anyone can still hit your API directly using curl, Postman, a bash script, or their own frontend.

CORS only tells the browser which sites are allowed to call your API **via JavaScript**. It doesn't restrict access at the network level. It doesn't check tokens. It doesn't block unauthorized users.

CORS is a browser behavior filter — **not** a gatekeeper for your data.

So if your API has no authentication, it's public. Period. Doesn't matter what your CORS policy says.

## **Conclusion**

CORS isn't magic. It doesn't secure your API. It's just a browser rule that says "you can only talk to this server if the server says it's okay."

It protects users, not servers. It's enforced by the browser, not the backend. And if your app works in Postman but not in Chrome, chances are you're just missing a header — not a whole security model.

So next time you see a CORS error, take a breath. It's not a bug. It's just the browser doing its job.
